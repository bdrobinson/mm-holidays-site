        We are currently setting up a new bank account and will send you the
        payment details in the next couple of months. Once you have the details,
        you will need to pay the deposit of £40 (or the full fee if you prefer)
        within 2 weeks in order to keep your place(s). The full balance is due
        by 31st May 2025.

        We will continue to send important information via email, particularly
        near the holiday.
