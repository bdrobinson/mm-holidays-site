## 1. How do I book a place at Max, Madness or Mayhem?
You can [book online](/booking). Usually we would ask that the completed application be accompanied by a non-returnable deposit. However, as part of becoming a CIO (Charitable Incorporated Organisation) we are currently setting up a new bank account. We will be in touch with the account details in the next couple of months but want you to be able to secure your place by completing the booking form. Applications will be dealt with on a date-received priority basis, and you will receive an email of confirmation regarding your booking once it has been processed.

Once we have shared bank details with you, we will require a deposit of £40 within two weeks or your place will be cancelled. The balance of the holiday fees is due by 31st May 2025. You will not receive a reminder of the balance due. If payment is not received by this date, we reserve the right to advise you of cancellation of your booking and the loss of your deposit. If you book within eight weeks of the start of the holiday, full fees are due with the application. Holiday places are limited so please book early. M+M Holidays reserves the right to refuse any application.

## 2. What is included in the cost of the holiday?
The price includes full board and accommodation, one Frontier Centre-led activity, equipment and any excursions. The holiday is based at The Frontier Centre, Northamptonshire. Accommodation arrangements are in single sex bedrooms (or tents for Mayhem boys only), generally sleeping between two and eight young people. In an effort to keep the cost of the holiday as affordable as possible, most volunteer team members also donate the same amount as the cost of a place for a camper. 

## 3. What about travel?
The cost of travel to and from the holiday is not included in the fee. Parents and carers are responsible for the travel arrangements to and from the holiday. 

## 4. Financial Assistance
In cases of financial hardship, M+M Holidays may be able to help you access charitable funding to subsidise the cost of the holiday. The David Chilcott Fund can assist with up to ⅓ of the cost of the holiday. Parents, carers and youth leaders can apply here: [Grant Application Form | CRNET (Formally CCI)](https://www.crnet.org.uk/application-form)

Further financial assistance may be available from M+M Holidays. Wherever possible, please make us aware of any need at the time of booking. 

## 5. Sibling Discounts
A sibling discount of £30 from the cost of the holiday is available for the second and subsequent children from the same family who are resident at the same address. Since this will be drawn from our charitable donated funds, please only make use of this where there is need. Please indicate your wish to apply the discount on the booking form.

## 6. What if the holiday is cancelled by M+M Holidays?
M+M Holidays reserves the right to alter or cancel any activities, accommodation, excursions or other arrangements if unforeseen circumstances arise. We will only cancel the holiday if the minimum number of bookings required for the holiday to take place has not been received, or if unforeseen circumstances arise outside our control. In such an event we guarantee to refund any fees in the following manner: if the holiday has not started, fees will be refunded in full. If part of the holiday has taken place then a proportion of the fees appropriate to the circumstances will be refunded.

## 7. What if I cancel?
If you decide to cancel your application you must inform the Booking Secretary in writing. Notification of cancellation will only be effective from the date it is actually received in writing. If more than 56 days’ notice is received prior to commencement of the holiday, only the deposit is forfeited. If your cancellation is received less than 56 days prior to the commencement of the holiday, the following charges will be made:
- 30 – 56 days: 50% of total published price
- 7 – 29 days: 75% of total published price
- 0 – 6 days: 100% of total published price

## 8. What if my child is unwell?
In the event of your child being unwell at the start of the holiday, we adhere to current NHS guidelines for school attendance, which can be found [here](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Yourchildatschool/Pages/Illness.aspx). Children with diarrhoea and/or vomiting must not be sent to the holiday until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have gone. If a child has a raised temperature, they too must not be sent until their symptoms have gone. We regret that we cannot offer a refund if a child is unable to attend due to ill health – please see the section below relating to insurance.

## 9. What about insurance?
You are strongly advised to take out cover against cancellation, personal accident and theft. Personal property is the young people’s responsibility at all times, unless any loss or damage is due to our negligence or failure to carry out our responsibilities. Madness and Mayhem Holidays is insured for public liability up to £10m.

## 10. Safeguarding
The safety and well-being of every individual on our holidays is of the utmost importance. M+M Holidays adheres to our [safeguarding policy](/safeguarding).  All those leading on M+M Holidays undergo an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and provide two referees from whom we take up references. The team receives regular safeguarding training.

## 11. Safety
Safety is taken seriously throughout the holiday. All activities are risk assessed with mitigations put in place to minimise risk to an appropriate level. All outdoor pursuit activities are carried out under qualified supervision by Frontier Centre staff and accompanied by our own leaders. All recommended safety equipment is always worn and is checked and maintained to a high standard. 

## 12. Additional Needs
M+M Holidays aims to be as inclusive as possible within the guidelines of suitable provision and staffing. If your child(ren) has needs that require extra support we ask that parents and carers give us full details of their particular needs at the time of applying for a place on the holiday so that we can decide whether we are able to suitably care for them. Please also advise us at the time of booking, if a child currently has or has recently experienced any behavioural or social problems which may affect their own safety and/or the well-being of others on the holiday.

## 13. The Team
M+M Holidays is run by an experienced adult team of committed Christians who sign up to a [declaration of faith](/faith) taken from UCCF and CEEC. Our leaders are DBS checked; provide 2 referees from whom we take up references and are given appropriate training, including safeguarding, prior to the holiday. 

## 14. Behaviour
It is expected that campers at a Madness and Mayhem Holiday will participate, as they are able, in the holiday including the teaching sessions. We expect reasonable behaviour throughout the holiday. Anyone who grossly or repeatedly misbehaves will be sent home. Smoking (including vaping) and alcohol are NOT permitted on Madness and Mayhem Holidays. In the unlikely event of anyone being caught in possession of controlled drugs, they will automatically be referred to the police. Collection from the holiday will be the responsibility, and at the expense, of the parent/carer. Parents will be required to pay for deliberate damage caused by their children. If a child is sent home from the holiday, no refund will be given.

## 15. Mobile Phones
Max (9-11s) and Madness (12-14s) are mobile phone free holidays. We are keen to protect the young people attending our holidays from the pressures and distractions that mobile phones can bring, whilst fully embracing all that a week away together offers. Should you need to contact your child in an emergency, you will have a leader’s number that you can call. Similarly, we are able to arrange for your child to call you using a leader’s phone.

Mayhem (15-18s) may use their phones at designated times, but are expected to switch off and store their phones for the rest of the time. Phones are taken in overnight and returned the following day. Leaders have permission to remove phones if needed. 

## 16. Data Protection
M+M Holidays complies with their Data Protection Policy. We will treat the information given on the booking form in total confidence (except as required by law) and store it in full accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018. It will be kept so that we can provide you with the information and services that best match your requirements and preferences. We may take videos and photographs of holiday activities and, unless permission has been declined on the application form, these may appear in future publicity or other materials produced by M+M Holidays.
