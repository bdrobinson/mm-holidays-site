## 1. How do I book a place at MAX, Madness or Mayhem?

Complete all sections of the [Application Form](M+M_Application_Form.pdf) (page 1-2) and send it to the Booking Secretary (contact details on booking form and below) or [book online](/booking). The completed application must be accompanied by a non-returnable deposit of £40 – cheques should be payable to ‘M&M Holidays fees account’. Applications will be dealt with on a date-received priority basis, and you will receive a letter or email of confirmation regarding your booking once it has been processed. Holiday places are limited so please book early.

## 2. What about payment?

Cheques for holiday fees should be made payable to ‘M&M Holidays fees account’. The balance of the holiday fees is due by 31st May 2020. You will not receive a reminder of the balance due. If payment is not received by this date, we reserve the right to advise you of cancellation of your booking and the loss of your deposit. If you book within eight weeks of the start of a holiday, full fees are due with the application. In cases of financial hardship, Urban Saints may be able to help you access charitable funding to subsidise the cost of the holiday. Wherever possible please make us aware of any need at the time of booking.

## 3. What is included in the cost of the holiday?

The price includes full board and accommodation and a wide range of activities. The holiday publicity gives details of the type of accommodation (tents or dormitories), activities and any travel arrangements included in the published price. The cost of any optional additional activities and trips will be advised to you by the holiday leader or organiser. Pocket money is not included in the cost of the holiday. All meals on the holiday are included in the cost, from the evening meal on the day of arrival to breakfast on the day of departure. We are happy to provide for medical dietary needs and vegetarian diets if notified in advance.

## 4. Sibling Discounts

A sibling discount of £30 from the cost of the holiday is available for the second and subsequent children from the same family who are resident at the same address. Since this will be drawn from our charitable donated funds, please only make use of this where there is need.

## 5. What about price increases?

Urban Saints reserves the right to alter or cancel any activities, accommodation, travel or other arrangements if unforeseen circumstances arise. If the price of your holiday is liable to a surcharge as a result of currency fluctuations, or an increase in transportation costs, we will bear any cost increases up to 2% of the holiday fee. However, we reserve the right to impose a surcharge if our costs increase by more than 2%. If any surcharge equates to more than 10% of the holiday price, you will be entitled to cancel, with a full refund of all money paid. Should you decide to cancel because of this, you must exercise your right to do so within 14 days from the issue date of the printed notification. We will not increase any fees within 30 days of the start of the holiday.

## 6. What if the holiday is cancelled by Urban Saints?

We will only cancel a holiday if the minimum number of bookings required for the holiday to take place has not been received, or if unforeseen circumstances arise outside our control. In such an event we guarantee to refund any fees in the following manner: if the holiday has not started, fees will be refunded in full or, if an alternative holiday is chosen, any difference will be refunded. If part of the holiday has taken place then a proportion of the fees appropriate to the circumstances will be refunded.

## 7. What if I should cancel?

If you decide to cancel your application you must inform the Booking Secretary in writing. Notification of cancellation will only be effective from the date it is actually received in writing. If more than 56 days’ notice is received prior to commencement of the holiday, only the deposit is forfeited. If your cancellation is received less than 56 days prior to the commencement of the holiday, the following charges will be made:

**56 – 43 days**: 35% of total published price

**42 – 29 days**: 75% of total published price

**28 days or less**: 100% of total published price

## 8. What about insurance?

You are strongly advised to take out cover against cancellation, personal accident and theft. Personal property is the young people’s responsibility at all times, unless any loss or damage is due to our negligence or failure to carry out our responsibilities. Urban Saints are insured for public liability up to £10m.

## 9. Contractual terms

In compliance with the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992, you need to be aware that as soon as the request for a place has been acknowledged in writing or by email, a contract exists between Urban Saints, Kestin House, 45 Crescent Road, LUTON, LU2 0AH and the parent or guardian of the young person wishing to attend the holiday, should he/she be under 18 on the day the application is accepted.

## 10. Smoking, alcohol and illegal substances

Smoking and alcohol are NOT permitted on Urban Saints Holidays. In the unlikely event of anyone being caught in possession of controlled drugs, they will automatically be referred to the police.

## 11. Bad behaviour

It is expected that all participants at an Urban Saints Holiday will behave reasonably. Anyone who grossly or repeatedly misbehaves will be sent home. Collection from the holiday will be the responsibility, and at the expense, of the parent/guardian. Parents will be required to pay for deliberate damage caused by their children.

## 12. Other stuff

Urban Saints will treat the information given on the booking form in total confidence (except as required by law) and store it in full accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. It will be kept so that we can provide you with the information and services that best match your requirements and preferences. We may take videos and photographs of holiday activities and, unless permission has been declined on the application form, these may appear in future publicity or other materials produced by Urban Saints, or materials produced by other organisations in sympathy with Urban Saints and to whom express permission to use the videos/photographs has been granted. Your details will only be made known to others outside of Urban Saints where we use, or collaborate with, other people or organisations to carry out work on our behalf. A duty of confidentiality will be imposed on such people and organisations.
