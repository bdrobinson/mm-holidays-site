If you’re 15 to 18 years old, Mayhem is for you.

Mayhem is a chance to hang out with friends, meet new people and try a whole range of activities. There’s a friendly, relaxed atmosphere and you’ll have plenty of free time to chat and unwind throughout the week.

It’s also an opportunity to take some time out and think about life’s big questions. We’ll be exploring the claims of the Bible together and discussing whether Jesus is relevant to life today.

Mayhem books up fast, so invite all your friends and start reserving your spaces. The cost is £239 for the week, with bursaries/extra funding available if required. We’re looking forward to seeing you there.
