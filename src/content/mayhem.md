Mayhem runs for 15-17 year olds. Mayhem provides time and space for older teenagers to enjoy a chilled but simply brilliant holiday with their friends. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to meet new people and enjoy a fantastic variety of activities including some brilliant optional extras. There are plenty of options for everyone with our excellent onsite facilities as well  as free time to chat, make craft or even just enjoy the great space of our fantastic new site.

As well as all of that Mayhem provides time out for older teenagers to think about what life is really all about and evaluate the claims of Jesus Christ and his relevance to their lives today in the 21st century. You do not need to be a Christian or know anything about the Bible to come and enjoy a fantastic holiday. Why not bring a friend with you?
