We want all young people to be able to join us on camp, regardless of their financial circumstances. Bursaries are available to any child whose parent or carer will find it hard to meet the full cost of the holiday (eg receiving benefits, or struggling financially in the current climate).

# What's available

The bursary varies in size depending on individual circumstances. Parents, carers and youth leaders can apply to [the David Chilcott Fund](https://www.crnet.org.uk/application-form) for up to 1/3 of the cost of the holiday. 

If further financial assistance is needed, bursaries are available from the M+M Trust. Please email <mmtrust@madnessandmayhem.org.uk> to apply.
