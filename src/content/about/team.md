M+M is run by a team of evangelical Christians from different walks of life, churches and denominations from across the country. All our leaders are volunteers and give towards the cost of the holiday themselves.

Each leader is referenced and checked through the National Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly CRB). In addition we hold an annual training weekend ahead of the holiday which all leaders are required to attend. This ensures all leaders are thoroughly equipped and trained for all the activities on our holidays. They work in balanced teams of male and female which also have a range of experience. Some are parents and bring along their own children, others are younger and/or trainees on our 10:45 programme and there are lots of us in between too!

Contact us if you would be interested in serving as a leader.
