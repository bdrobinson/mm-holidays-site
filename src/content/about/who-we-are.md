M+M is run by a team of Christians from across the country.

Our team is a wonderful mixture of people from different ages and stages,
including experienced holiday leaders and parents. We’re all volunteers and
we donate towards the cost of the holiday ourselves.

All our team members are referenced and checked through the National
Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly CRB). We also hold an annual training
weekend ahead of the holiday which all our team members are required to
attend. This is to make sure that all of us are thoroughly equipped and trained
for all the activities on our holidays.

We also have a team of trainee leaders on our ‘10:45 Programme’.

If you would be interested in joining our team as a holiday leader, we’d love to
hear from you.
