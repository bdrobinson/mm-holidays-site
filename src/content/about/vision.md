At M+M Holidays (Max, Madness and Mayhem) our aim is to run an
unforgettable week of activities, fun and friendship, with clear and faithful
teaching from the Bible. We want to present Jesus Christ to the children and
young people and to encourage them to follow Him, without any pressure.

M+M Holidays has been running since 2001. Weâ€™re a part of [Urban Saints](http://www.urbansaints.org/holidays/)
Holidays, an inter-denominational Christian youth organisation aiming to reach
children and young people with the good news of Jesus Christ.

You can read the basis of faith of Urban Saints [here](http://www.urbansaints.org/faith).

The team members who teach at M+M also sign up to the [UCCF doctrinal
basis](http://www.uccf.org.uk/about-us/doctrinal-basis.htm).
