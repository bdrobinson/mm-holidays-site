At M+M Holidays our aim is to run an unforgettable week of activities, fun and friendship, with clear and faithful teaching from the Bible. We want to present Jesus Christ to children and young people and to encourage them to follow Him, without any pressure.

M+M Holidays has been running since 2001. We're a charity-run organisation.  You can read our basis of faith [here](/faith), which all of our leaders sign up to.
