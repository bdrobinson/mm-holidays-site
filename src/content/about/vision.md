At M+M Holidays (MAX, Madness + Mayhem) our aim is to lay on a superb, unforgettable experience (activities, fun and friendship) together with clear and faithful Bible teaching — equally unforgettable. In an unpressured way we want to present children and young people with the person of the risen Jesus Christ and encourage them to follow Him.

We’re a part of [Urban Saints](http://www.urbansaints.org/holidays/) Holidays, an inter-denominational Christian youth organisation aiming to reach children and young people with the good news of Jesus Christ (Urban Saints was formerly known as ‘Crusaders’).
