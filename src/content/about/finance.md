The ‘creature comforts’ of M+M don’t come cheap – yet parents often tell us M+M Holidays are brilliant value for money.

We work hard to keep the cost down, charging only what we need to in order to make M+M happen. The cost of M+M is all inclusive of food, accommodation and travel during the holiday.

Even so we don’t want money to stop anyone coming to M+M. So, if the cost is a problem, please get in touch with us as we can help you get access to charitable assistance as necessary.

Also, we know that families who have more than one child coming sometimes find M+M summer holidays particularly expensive. A sibling discount is available for second and subsequent siblings resident at the same address.
