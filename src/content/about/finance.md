We want to make M+M great value for money.

We work hard to keep costs down and charge only what we need to for
running the week. The cost of M+M includes all meals, accommodation and
travel during the holiday.

We donâ€™t want the cost to stop anyone coming to M+M. If the cost is a
problem, please get in touch with us. We can help you get access to charitable
assistance as necessary.

We also know that families who have more than one child coming sometimes
find M+M summer holidays particularly expensive. A sibling discount is
available for second and subsequent siblings resident at the same address.
