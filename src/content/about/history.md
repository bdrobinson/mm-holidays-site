Madness + Mayhem was first based at Smallwood Manor Preparatory School (near Uttoxeter) and has been running in its present form since 2001 (although it owes a lot to various Crusader residential holidays before that).

After moving to Royal Wolverhampton School in 2006, a second week was added in 2008 to accommodate more people. A junior form of M+M was added in 2010 â€“ M+M MAX.

From 2014-2016 we have run ran MAX, Madness and Mayhem simultaneously in one week at Repton School in Derbyshire.

Since 2017 M+M Holidays has been based at [The Rock Frontier Centre](http://www.rockuk.org/centres/frontier-centre) in Northampton.
