At M+M Holidays, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data when you or your child participate in our summer camp programs. By registering for or attending M+M, you agree to the practices described in this policy. The M+M Data Protection Lead will comply with their legal obligation to protect your data.

Most of the data we handle is essential for our legitimate interests. For instance, this includes our safeguarding efforts to protect children and vulnerable adults. We will always consider your interests, rights, and freedoms. Certain data processing is required to fulfill our legal obligations. For example, we must conduct DBS checks for all staff and volunteers and disclose specific aggregated data in our annual reports. If none of these legal bases apply, we may seek your consent before proceeding.

## Information We Collect

We collect personal information in order to register campers, facilitate camp operations, and communicate with participants. Your consent will always be gathered when processing new information. This may include:
- **Registration Information:** Name, date of birth, gender, address, phone number, email address, and emergency contact details.
- **Health Information:** Medical history, allergies, medications, insurance information, and emergency medical contacts (if applicable).
- **Payment Information:** Bank account details and billing address for payment processing.
- **Activity and Camp Participation Data:** Preferences for activities, attendance, and participation records during the camp.
- **Parent/Guardian Information:** Name, address, phone number, and email address of the parent or guardian.
- **Photography consent forms:** Name, photographs and video images.

The data we process may include special category personal data, as our mission involves organising Christian holidays for children and young people. The nature of the data we handle, along with the fact that we are processing it, could indicate your religious beliefs. Additionally, if you provide this information, we may process other types of special category personal data, such as details about injuries, medications or treatments, and safeguarding information, which are necessary for the safe delivery of our activity holidays.

## How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
- To process camp registrations and payments.
- To ensure the safety and well-being of campers by managing medical, emergency, and safeguarding information.
- To communicate with parents/guardians
- To send marketing materials or newsletters related to camp activities (with consent).
- To improve our services by gathering feedback.

## How We Share Your Information
We may share personal information under the following circumstances:
With Third-Party Service Providers: We may share your information with trusted vendors who help us provide services such as activity providers. These vendors are bound by confidentiality agreements and are not allowed to use your information for purposes beyond those necessary to provide these services.
In Case of Emergency: In the event of an emergency, we may share necessary health or medical information with medical professionals or emergency responders.
Legal and Compliance Purposes: If required by law or legal processes, we may disclose personal information to comply with a court order, subpoena, or other legal obligation.

## Data Security
We implement reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure. However, no data transmission or storage system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## Retention of Information
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may keep some other records for an extended period of time. For example, it is currently best practice to keep financial records for a minimum period of 7 years to support HMRC audits. In general, data will be deleted when it is no longer needed.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 18 without the consent of their parent or guardian. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 18, we will take steps to delete it.

## Your Rights
You have the following rights in relation to your personal data:
- **Being informed:** You will be informed about how, why, and on what basis your data is being processed.
- **Access:** You may - at any time - request access to the personal information we hold about you. 
- **Corrections:** You may request corrections if the information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete.
- **Request erasure:** You may request for your data to be erased if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected/processed, or if there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing.
- **Opt-out of Communications:** You can opt-out of receiving communications by contacting us directly at the below address.

However, these rights are not absolute, and there may be legal reasons why, for example, your data must be retained even when you request its erasure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on our website with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
