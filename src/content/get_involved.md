# Leading
M+M Holidays are able to run due to a great team of leaders who are passionate about serving Christ through sharing the gospel with 9-17 year olds. Our leaders come from a range of different local churches across the country.

We are always looking for new leaders to come and serve with us. We promise you a fantastic, exhausting and worthwhile opportunity to share the gospel with many young people.

Our annual leaders weekend is an essential part of serving on M+M Holidays and will provide time to meet the team and training to equip you to serve on an M+M Holiday.

For more information, email us at <info@madnessandmayhem.org.uk>.

# 10:45 scheme
*&ldquo;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&rdquo;* &mdash; Mark 10:45

M+M is committed to training up the next generation of leaders who can faithfully pass on and live out the gospel message, both on summer camps and within their local churches. M+M provides the opportunity for 17-19 year old committed Christians to learn and put their faith into action by serving Christ and the work of the gospel on camp.

On the M+M 10:45 scheme you will be expected to serve, carry out a range of ministry support tasks, assist in the pastoral care of a group of young people, be a member of the Holiday leadership team, benefit from your own tailored teaching, get tired and worn out (guaranteed), know that your work will make a difference for all eternity and put the Lordâ€™s great commission into practice.

For more information, email us at <info@madnessandmayhem.org.uk>.

# Giving
M+M is a non-profit organisation, and as such we aim to keep our costs and prices as low as possible. However, even then finance can be a barrier for some campers.

For that reason, the Madness and Mayhem Trust was set up in 2007. As an independent charitable trust it aims to provide financial support by providing grant assistance to make M+M Holidays more affordable and accessible to as many young people as possible.

If you would like to make a donation to the Madness and Mayhem Trust to enable them to help the work of M+M to continue and grow, please don't hesitate to get in contact. Donations can be gift-aided if the donor is a tax payer.

You can contact the Secretary of the Madness and Mayhem Trust at <mmtrust@madnessandmayhem.org.uk>.
