MAX is a safe, fun and action packed holiday for 9-11 year olds. We provide a wide variety of activities both onsite and offsite as well as faithful and age appropriate Bible teaching. Our leadership team boasts a wealth of experience working with this age group. Our leaders will help them settle in and care for them throughout the week to ensure they have a great time away. You do not need to be a Christian or know anything about the Bible to come and enjoy a fantastic holiday. Why not bring a friend with you?
