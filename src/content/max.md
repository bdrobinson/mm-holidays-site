MAX is a safe, fun and action packed holiday for 9-11 year olds. We provide a wide variety of activities both onsite and offsite as well as faithful and age appropriate Bible teaching. Our leadership team boasts a wealth of experience working with this age group. Our leaders will help them settle in and care for them throughout the week to ensure they have a great time away. You do not need to be a Christian or know anything about the Bible to come and enjoy a fantastic holiday. Why not bring a friend with you?
In 2018 the holiday runs from Saturday 28th July – Saturday August 4th.

Currently places are full across the holidays. If you would like to be added to our waiting list, please complete the online booking form but don’t pay the deposit, M&M 2018 Booking Form. We will be in touch, should a place become available.
