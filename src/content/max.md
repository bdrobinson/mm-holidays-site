If you’re 9 to 11 years old, Max is the holiday for you.

Max is a week of fantastic activities and great teaching from the Bible. You’ll get to try games, crafts and challenges, and take exciting day trips with all your new friends. We’ll learn more about the awesome God who made the universe and find out the answers to some of life’s biggest questions.

When you arrive, our experienced team of leaders will help you settle in. They’ll look after you throughout the week and make sure that you have a brilliant holiday.

Max costs £250, but bursaries/extra funding are available if required. Also included in the price this year is a trip to the fantastic [Twin Lakes theme park](https://www.twinlakespark.co.uk/) and a separate activity choice of raft building, canoeing or King Swing.

Tell all your friends and get ready for the best week of the year. It’s going to be
epic...
