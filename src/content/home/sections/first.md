M+M is three holidays in one. There’s Max (for ages 9 to 11), Madness (for ages 12 to 14) and Mayhem (for ages 15 to 18).

All three holidays run at the same time on the same site in Northamptonshire,
but they each have a separate programme throughout the week. For example,
if you’re on Madness you’ll be spending most of the week with other 12 to 14
year olds.

But regardless of age group, you’ll get the same great combination of fun, friends and Bible teaching.
