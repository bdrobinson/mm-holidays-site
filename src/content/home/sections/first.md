M+M is three holidays in one. There’s Max (for ages 9 to 11), Madness (for ages 12 to 14) and Mayhem (for ages 15 to 18).

All three holidays run at the same time on the same site in Northamptonshire,
but they each have a separate programme throughout the week. For example,
if you’re on Madness you’ll be spending most of the week with other 12 to 14
year olds.

M+M runs over two weeks! This means there’s room for more of your
friends to join in. Week 1 is from 25th July to 1st August and Week 2 is from
1st to 8th August.

Whether you choose Week 1 or Week 2, you’ll get the same great combination
of fun, friends and Bible teaching.
