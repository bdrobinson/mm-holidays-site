At M+M we want to give young people a chance to think about what they believe and discover more of what the Bible says about Jesus. Everyone is welcome, whatever their beliefs or background.

Throughout the week there will be Bible talks and discussion groups, led by our leaders. It’s a great opportunity to ask questions and think about life’s big issues in a relaxed, friendly environment.
