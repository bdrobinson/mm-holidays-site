There’s been a lot of bad news in the world recently, but in the Bible we get to read some really good news and it’s all about Jesus. Whether you don’t know much about Jesus or you have been learning about him for some time, we would love for you to join us on M+M Online and hear more about why Jesus is such good news.

Camp won’t be quite the same this year, but it’ll still be packed with the M+M goodness we all love. What’s more, it’s now easier than ever to invite your friends so that they can join in the fun and hear about Jesus too.
