M+M Online is a digital version of our Max, Madness and Mayhem summer camps, for summer 2020.

Because of the lockdown restrictions in the UK, we can’t stay at the Frontier Centre and spend the week together as we usually would on camp. So, for one year and (hopefully) one year only, we’re running camp online, so that you can join in from your home.

From Monday 3 August until Friday 7 August 2020, we’ll be bringing you daily videos, featuring Bible talks, leaders’ testimonies, games, challenges and more. There’ll be an M+M Breakfast Show every morning for each of our three camps (Max for 9-11s, Madness for 12-14s and Mayhem for 15-18s) and if you’re on Mayhem you can also join us for The M+M Late Show in the evenings.
