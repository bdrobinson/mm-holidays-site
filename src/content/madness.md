If you’re 12 to 14 years old and you’re ready for the best week of the year, come and join us on Madness.

Madness is an action-packed holiday for everyone aged 12 to 14. A typical day on Madness would start with an adventure on the high ropes, chill time with friends on the grass and then victory with your team in a nail-biting wide game. And that’s all before lunch.

It’s a great chance to make friends for life from across the country and explore what the Bible says about Jesus. There’s time to think things through, chat with friends and ask all your burning questions.

Madness costs £250, but bursaries/extra funding are available if required.

Whether you’re new to Madness or you’ve been before, we can’t wait to see you there. Invite your friends and get packing for the best week of the year…
