Madness runs for 12-14 year olds and is packed with the chance to have fun, make friends from across the country and to consider the claims of Jesus Christ for themselves in an informal but informed way.

Madness provides a fantastic variety of activities. There are plenty of options for everyone with our excellent onsite facilities as well as free time to chat, make craft or even just enjoy the space our fantastic new site. You do not need to be a Christian or know anything about the Bible to come and enjoy a fantastic holiday. Why not bring a friend with you? Itâ€™s guaranteed to be the best week of your year!
